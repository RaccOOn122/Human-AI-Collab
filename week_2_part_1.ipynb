    "\n",
    "### Guidelines:\n",
    "- Choose a source (e.g. Reddit, Wikipedia tables, GitHub, open APIs)\n",
    "- Extract and store the data using Python (e.g. `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, or an API client)\n",
    "- Save a copy of the data locally (as CSV)\n",

    "- A working script that gathers the data\n",
